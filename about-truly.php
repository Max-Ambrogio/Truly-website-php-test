				<h6>About Truly</h6>
				<h1>What's in the can?</h1>
				<p>Good question. The short answer? A whole lot.
					Inside every can of Truly is a fresh adventure just waiting to be opened (also plenty of seltzer).
					That's because you never know where your next sip will take you. Maybe a boat. Maybe a bar crawl. 
					Maybe boarding a flight to that secluded island off the coast of Croatia you always thought about going to — you know,
					the one with the bottomless seafood buffet? Yeah, you know.

				<p>If that sounded a little dramatic, good. We want you to feel important. 
					After all, you Truly lovers, are the reason we do all this.
						Well, that and the morning tasting sessions. Hey, we can't say no to a noon happy hour.</p>

						<h2>Always look on the Sweet side</h2>
						<p>Life is pretty sweet when you think about it. 
							At least, that's what we like to remind ourselves when prepping for our next adventure.
							 The end result? Happier days, better memories, and cortisol levels that would make a stress ball jealous.

						<h2>Don't worry, be Truly</h2>
						<p>Our philosophy is simple: Look forward and recline backward.
							 After all, life's too short to worry that much. So consider this your cue: 
							 Kick up your feet, crack open a can, and drink it allllll in.
